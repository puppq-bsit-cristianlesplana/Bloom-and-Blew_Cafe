# Bloom and Brew Cafe — POS System

A fully functional cafe point-of-sale and restaurant management system built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript only** — no framework, no build step, no external server. Uses the browser's built-in IndexedDB for persistent data storage that survives page reloads.

Live demo via GitHub Pages or open `index.html` directly in any modern browser.

## System Workflow

The POS implements a complete order-to-kitchen-to-inventory workflow:

1. **Order Entry** — Cashier selects Dine In or Take Out, picks a table (for dine-in), selects menu items, chooses Iced/Hot for coffee, builds the cart
2. **Stock Validation** — Items with out-of-stock ingredients are marked "Unavailable" and cannot be ordered; low-stock items show remaining servings
3. **Checkout** — System computes subtotal, configurable tax, and total; cashier enters cash tendered
4. **Send to Kitchen** — Confirmed order is saved to the database and appears in Kitchen Queue with a countdown timer
5. **Table Management** — Occupied tables are tracked; new orders auto-select the next available table; if all tables are full, orders are tagged "Waiting"
6. **Inventory Deduction** — Ingredients used in the order are automatically deducted from stock
7. **Low Stock Alerts** — If any ingredient drops below threshold, a Manager Approval alert is created
8. **Restock Approval** — Manager views stock details and approves the restock, which replenishes inventory and re-enables affected menu items
9. **Auto-Complete** — Dine-in orders auto-complete after 3 minutes (demo mode), freeing the table for waiting orders

## Modules

### 1. Landing Page
- Branded starter screen with cafe logo and tagline

## Database Schema

Five IndexedDB object stores:

| Store        | Key    | Contents |
|--------------|--------|----------|
| `menuItems`  | `id`   | Name, price, category, image path, and ingredient usage per item |
| `inventory`  | `name` | Stock level, unit, category, and low-stock threshold per ingredient |
| `orders`     | `id`   | Items, totals, payment info, order type, table, status, timestamps |
| `approvals`  | `id`   | Low-stock/out-of-stock alerts and their approval status |
| `meta`       | `key`  | System settings — order counter, tax rate, seeded flag, DB version |

### Key Database Functions
- `seedIfEmpty()` — Seeds menu, inventory, tax rate, and order counter on first run
- `createOrder()` — Assigns order ID, saves order with status, order type, and table
- `updateOrderStatus()` — Moves order through the workflow stages
- `deductInventoryForOrder()` — Subtracts ingredient usage; creates alerts if below threshold
- `approveRestock()` — Marks alert approved; replenishes ingredient stock
- `resetStockOnly()` — Resets inventory without affecting orders or settings
- `resetDatabase()` — Full factory reset

### Auto-Reset
The database auto-clears stale data when the `DB_VERSION` is bumped. No manual console commands needed — the `localStorage`-based version check handles it automatically on page load.

## Responsive Design

| Breakpoint | Behavior |
|------------|----------|
| Desktop (>1024px) | Full sidebar with text labels, 4-column grids |
| Tablet (<=1024px) | Narrower sidebar, 3-column grids |
| Mobile (<=768px) | Top bar with hamburger + logo; sidebar as 200px slide-out with labels and cashier name |
| Phone (<=480px) | 2-column grids, stacked layouts, compact headers |

---

## Menu Categories

| Category | Items | Price Range |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| Coffee | 11 drinks (Americano, Cafe Latte, Vanilla Latte, etc.) | P45–P59 |
| Ice Shaken | 4 drinks (Chocolate, Toffee Nut, Black Tea, Hibiscus Tea) | P55–P59 |
| Non-Coffee | 7 drinks (Matcha Latte, Tangerine Tea, Iced Chocolate, etc.) | P25–P35 |
| Snacks | 11 items (Ube Crinkles, Avocado Toast, Pasta Carbonara, etc.) | P39–P129 |

**Total: 33 menu items**

---

## Table Management

- 10 tables available (Table 1 through Table 10)
- Table selector with +/- stepper and real-time Available/Occupied status
- After placing a dine-in order, the system auto-selects the next available table
- If all tables are occupied, the order is tagged "Waiting"
- When a table frees up (order completed, auto-completed, or cancelled), the oldest waiting order is automatically assigned to the freed table
- Take Out orders bypass table management entirely

---

## Dine-In Timer (Demo Mode)

- Dine-in orders auto-complete after **3 minutes** to simulate customer turnover
- Kitchen cards show a live countdown timer that updates every 5 seconds
- Timer turns red when under 30 seconds remaining
- On auto-complete, the table is freed and waiting orders are assigned
- Take Out orders have no timer

---

## Session Persistence

The app uses `sessionStorage` for page state (persists across refreshes, clears on tab close):
- `posActive` — Whether the POS is entered (skips landing page on refresh)
- `currentPage` — Which module was last active (restores on refresh)
- Clicking "Exit to Home" clears both, returning to the landing page

Held orders use `localStorage` so they persist even after closing the browser.

---

## Running the System

1. Open `index.html` in any modern browser, OR
2. Enable **GitHub Pages** on the repo (Settings > Pages > Branch: `main` / Folder: `/ (root)`)

No setup, no server, no installation — IndexedDB and localStorage are built into every modern browser.

---

## Resetting Data

**From Settings page:**
- "Reset Stock" — Restores inventory to defaults; keeps orders and prices
- "Reset All" — Full factory reset to original state

**Automatic:**
- Database auto-resets when `DB_VERSION` is bumped in `db.js`

---

## Known Limitations

- Cash is the only payment method (by design for this POS scope)
- No login/authentication — cashier name is configurable but static
- Data is local to the browser — not synced between devices
- Held orders use localStorage, not IndexedDB
- Dine-in timer is set to 3 minutes for demo purposes (configurable in code)
- No receipt printing to physical thermal printers (browser print only)
